Today we talked about images, functions, colors and styling.
We had an assignment where we had a function with arguments that would return an array and in that array, we needed to have certain elements then use those elements in a concatenated string then have a returned to us in a particular way.

I learned how to call a function within another function. It took me forever, but once I got it, it became easier and it was really good to have that ah hah moment.

However, I think when I had that ah hah moment, the group I was working with figured it out while I was stepping away so I felt really behind.

I'll review more on the weekend, resubmit my work, and get as much rest I can to prepare for what I hear is going to be the toughest week.
