Today we had a speaker come in and we discussed the readings from the night before about what makes a good team.

We then had an exercise where we got together with our groups to talk about our strengths and weaknesses or things we had to work upon.

Two of us had facial expression issues. One would look aloof and for me, I have a resting face that doesn't look too friendly that I let them be aware of. I think we could relate to the group that gets along because we've had a lot of conversations that have went onto tangents but we would always come back to the project topic.
