Today, we learned about lists and loops. A lot of my difficulty is knowing where to start with creating something from scratch. I ran into an issue and got help from Izzy. The issue was surrounding my json file because it was not viewable for some reason, so we removed it then created another file.

It was really helpful working with everyone as a team because it felt like there was one person who had a different piece of the puzzle. One of the most helpful things was learning about .includes. What it did was check the array for the value that was entered in as an answer from the prompt. It helped me because it meant I didn't have to write out a bunch of possible conditions to see if the user inputed any of those conditions.

Note to self:
Fix my repositories so it is more organized and clean.
Check your syntax.
