Today, we learned about object literals, DOM and problem domains.

I know how to create an object and understand the concept of a DOM, but I could not finish the lab tonight to save my life. Now I realize why Scott mentioned imposter syndrome today.

I feel very disappointed in myself, but I hope tomorrow, I can figure out a solution.

I'm going to switch from working on the lab right now to doing as much reading as I can before it gets too late, so I can at least try to have a fresh and ready mind for tomorrow.
