We went through live code today and it was extremely helpful.

I got the images to print and figured out how to make the chart appear after 25 clicks.

I had the one on one today and it went pretty well. Good to know I'm in the right place. Already bracing myself for the emotional rollercoaster ride.

Did the reading for tonight, but need to do the last two readings. However, since Thursday is a holiday and I don't have plans, I shall be playing catch up and working css for a resubmit.
