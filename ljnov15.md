Today, we watched Scott do live code and it was extremely helpful to see everywhere I got wrong. I notice that its easier to read code than produce it on my own at the moment. It also felt like a good learning experience listening to him explain the code as he wrote it.

We learned about forms and events today. The forms was pretty explanatory and the events was a little bit more complex, but easy to understand the concept of it. We talked about onSubmit and that by default, the browser refreshes after you submit, but you can disable that feature.

The lab was actually easier today. It took me awhile to get to where I ended and its still buggy, but its something I can definitely improve on.
