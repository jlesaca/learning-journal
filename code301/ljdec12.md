Yesterday, we worked on some wonderful CSS. I had some advice from a former TA that I'd have like to implement, but I felt it was too late to integrate it at the time I heard it. However, if given the time, or when (or if) I make it into 401 and have that week off, I'd really like to review CSS along with older material. 

Today, Shannon and I worked with AJAX. We used the example from the demo. We tried shorthand, but the longhand way worked better for us just because we were missing a part that we couldn't figure out.
