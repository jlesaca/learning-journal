The previous week was interesting with working in different pairs. There were many learning opportunities. 

It was interesting to see how Scott figured something out, but the way Steve and I did it was different, yet it still worked "because JavaScript" however it sucked being called on when Scott was doing it his way because I didn't know how to respond since my our way was... not the same. 

Working on Code Wars on my own was a bit refreshing because I got to do it at my own pace and do my own research. I got to use some things I learned on the previous katas like the % 2 == 0; to see if something is odd.
