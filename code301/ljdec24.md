Its been an extremely difficult week and especially difficult to work with someone via slack because my partner was sick. It was difficult because we couldn't actively look at the same things and talk about them.

Currently working on all my resubmits before midnight. Took the final exam. Just want to make sure I get everything in. 

Happy holidays!
