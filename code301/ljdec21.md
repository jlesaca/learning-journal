Today, Ozge and I made a very small amount of progress, however, we felt much better than we did yesterday. I feel like we have a bit of more understanding on how to look at things, but its definitely a struggle because sometimes I feel like we have two ideas of how things should work and when I say one thing she says another and we try both things and if we're lucky, at least one of us is correct. 

I'm also trying to get all my resubmits in! They'll be in soon I swear!
