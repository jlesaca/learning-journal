Friday I went to the bitcoin meetup. 
It wasn't as informational as I thought it would be. 
I ended up meeting two people and got their contacts. 

I finished the three kata's. 
I'm currently working on the lab trying to figure out how to use the sprites. I have content on the page appearing like the image provided, however, I didn't use the sprites. I may just have to work on it more tomorrow (later today) and just do a resubmit.
