The other day I was sick and felt way behind. I needed help with the UI challenge, but I got some questions answered and plan on resubmiting once I get the chance. 

I missed the functional programming lab and setting things up with my partner for the week, but I think I'm getting caught up to the level of lost everyone else seems to be in.
