Today, we learned about functions, links and layouts.

For lab, we did pair programming where one person was a driver and the other was a navigator. However, my group had three people so we had the observer help work as the navigator.

Also, I retook a quiz because I didn't see that we had one due this morning and I rushed to do it because it was 5 minutes before class and I just wanted to get it submitted. I ended up with a low score, but I retook it and because I was able to actually sit with the questions, I was able to get a full score.
