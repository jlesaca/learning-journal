Today was kind of a blur. Been fighting a migraine all day long.

I think class was very informative about what is to come for future classes. We created user stories.

The user stories are a bit helpful because they help guide you in your thought process. However, when it came to the lab, I couldn't focus because I'm not feeling well, and my migraine is getting worse because a lot of what I was trying wasn't working and it was frustrating me.

I decided to attempt the readings and get some rest so I can start tomorrow fresh and ready.
