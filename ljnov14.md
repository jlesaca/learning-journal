Today we talked about HTML tables and JS Constructor Functions.

I got the general idea of both and how to create a constructor, but the rest of the lab I was a bit more lost.

I wasn't able to complete the lab or get much to work and I didn't touch the HTML and I feel like I'm falling behind, but I'm going to keep working on it and improving so I can resubmit.

I'm extremely frustrated with myself.
